# Flooding Simulator

A visual flooding simulator built in Java. It uses terrain data to simulate water levels rising and spreading across different elevations.

Users can load terrain files, adjust water height, and observe how flooding would occur in real-time. The simulation is based on graph-based algorithms for efficient performance and accuracy.
